* My dot emacs

I recently declared .emacs.d bankruptcy. I had a few completion issues
that were getting annoying and wanted to check out some new packages
like selectrum so I thought I'd start from semi-scratch - new config
and copy over old pieces a bit at a time.

I also thought it would be a good time to start checking out the
straight package manager and selectrum.

I also decided that instead of converting my org file config each time
I loaded Emacs I'd add a hook to tangle it each time I save a change for faster
loading. 

Maybe I'll get back to making videos to show all of this. 

If you're looking for the older config that matches my earlier videos
(up to 77) look here
